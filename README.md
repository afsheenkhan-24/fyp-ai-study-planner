An AI-powered study planner that generates personalized, day‑by‑day study schedules based on your modules, deadlines, available time, and preferences. Built with Streamlit and Python, integrated with a local LLM (Ollama) and a SQL database for saving and tracking plans.

> ⚠️ This project is a **work in progress (WIP)**.  
> Features, UI, and the deployed app may change frequently as I continue developing and refining the system.

## 🌐 Live Demo

You can try the app online here:

👉 **[Open the live app](https://planmystudy.streamlit.app)**

No local setup needed – add your modules, deadlines, and availability in the browser and generate an AI‑powered study plan.

## ✨ Features

- **AI‑generated study plans** – Generate structured study schedules (e.g., daily blocks, priorities, topics) using a local Ollama model.
- **Module and task management** – Add modules, topics, and tasks with difficulty, estimated time, and due dates.
- **Time‑aware scheduling** – Plans respect your daily availability and upcoming exam/assignment deadlines to avoid overload.
- **Saved study plans** – Persist plans in a SQL database (from `schema.sql`) so you can revisit and update them later.
- **Streamlit web UI** – Clean, interactive interface split into multiple pages under the `pages/` directory.
- **Devcontainer support** – `.devcontainer` folder for a ready‑to‑use VS Code + Docker development environment.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend / UI:** Streamlit
- **Backend / Logic:** Python (`app.py`, `pages/`, `utils/`)
- **AI / LLM:** Groq (LLM, configurable model)
- **Database:** SQL database based on `schema.sql` (e.g., Postgres/Supabase‑style schema with a `StudyPlan` table)
- **Dev Environment:** VS Code Dev Containers, `requirements.txt` for dependencies
